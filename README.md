# Healthcare Analysis

Healthcare analytics is the use of advanced computing technology to improve medical care. Healthcare analytics improves medical care. The effectiveness of medical care is commonly measured using healthcare triple aim: improving outcomes, reducing costs, and ensuring quality. Healthcare analytics can be viewed as the intersection of three fields: healthcare (Healthcare Analytics), mathematics (Math), and computer science (CS).

The healthcare industry impacts all of us, through its interactions with ourselves, our loved ones, our family, and our friends. The high costs associated with the healthcare industry are intertwined with the physical, emotional, and spiritual trauma that occurs when someone close to us becomes ill or feels pain.

## Healthcare industry basics

Healthcare can be divided roughly into inpatient care, which is care that occurs in an overnight facility, such as a hospital, and outpatient, or ambulatory care, which is care that occurs on a same-day basis, usually in a physician’s office. Inpatient care is usually concerned with treating conditions that have progressed to a serious state or need complex interventions, and is usually costlier than outpatient care; therefore, a central goal in healthcare is to reduce the amount of care that occurs on an inpatient basis by emphasizing adequate preventive measures.

Another way to describe healthcare is by "stages of healthcare delivery." Primary care practitioners (PCPs) usually deal with the patient’s entire well-being and oversee all organ systems; in many care delivery models, they serve as "gatekeepers" to secondary and tertiary care providers. Secondary care denotes treatment by physicians specialized to treat certain
diseases or organ systems, such as endocrinologists or cardiothoracic surgeons. Tertiary care is provided upon referral by a specialist and usually occurs in an inpatient setting at a facility specialized to treat very specific conditions, often via surgery.

## Healthcare financing

In the US, healthcare financing is no longer completely private; in order to assist the
indigent and elderly populations, state and federal governments use taxes collected from citizens to fund Medicaid and Medicare, which are government-sponsored means of paying for healthcare for the poor and elderly, respectively. Once the money reaches the various third parties (insurance companies and/or the government), or while it is still in the possession of the patient, the money must be distributed to the physicians using a variety of payment models. In the following diagram, we provide a simplified overview of how money flows within the US healthcare system.

## Healthcare policy

Healthcare reform needs support from legislators if it is to succeed, and fortunately, it has received just that. Here are Some legislation that has paved the way for patients' rights and privacy, the rise of EMRs, value-based care, and the advancement of big data in healthcare, all of which are relevant to healthcare analytics.

### Protecting patient privacy and patient rights

Many countries around the world have enacted legislation for the protection of patient privacy. In the United States, legislation for protecting patient privacy was first signed into law in 1996 and is known as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). It has been revised and updated several times since then. Two of HIPAA’s main components are the Privacy Rule and the Security Rule.

The Privacy Rule states the specific situations for which healthcare data can be used. In particular, any information that can be used to identify the patient  (known as protected health information (PHI)) can be freely used for the purposes of medical treatment, bill payments, or other certain healthcare operations. Any other uses of the data require written authorization from the patient. A covered entity is an organization that is required to comply with HIPAA law; examples of covered entities include care providers and insurance plans. In 2013, the Final Omnibus Rule extended the jurisdiction of HIPAA to include business associates or independent contractors of the covered entities (which most healthcare analytics professionals can be categorized under if working with clients in the United States). Therefore, if you work with healthcare data in the United States, you must protect your patients’ data or face the risk of fines and/or imprisonment.

If you are a healthcare analytics professional, how should you protect the electronic patient health information (e-PHI) in your data? The Security Rule answers this question. The Security Rule breaks down the safeguarding methods into three categories: administrative, physical, and technical. Specifically, according to the website of the US Department of Health and Human Services, healthcare data scientists should: "ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all e-PHI" in their possession; protect against "reasonably anticipated threats" to the security of the information and impermissible uses or disclosures; and "ensure compliance by their workforce"

### Advancing the adoption of electronic medical records

EMRs, together with healthcare analytics, are seen as a possible remedy to escalating healthcare costs. In the United States, the major piece of  legislation that has promoted the use of EMRs is the Health Information  Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, passed in  2009 as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Braunstein, 2014). The HITECH Act provides incentive payments to healthcare
organizations that do two things:

* Adopt the use of "certified" electronic health records (EHRs)
* Use the EHRs in a meaningful fashion. Starting in 2015, healthcare providers who did not use EHRs were subject to penalization from their Medicare reimbursement.


### Promoting value-based care

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), also known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), was passed in 2010. The four original value-based programs:
* Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program (HVBP)
* Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP)
* Hospital Acquired Conditions Reduction Program (HAC)
* Value Modifier Program (VM)
